Benchmarks sources and results for [OSet](https://github.com/sciv-img/OSet).

Testing Machine: MacBook M1 Pro 10-core.
Swift version used: 5.8.

Goal: Subsecond timings for all of the following.

* Insert an element into OSet of 2.000.000 entries.
* Update an element in OSet of 2.000.000 entries.
* Remove an element from OSet of 2.000.000 entries.
* Check that OSet of 2.000.000 entries contains an element.
* Union two OSets of 100.000 entries each.
* Intersection of two OSets of 100.000 entries each.
* Subtracting two OSets of 100.000 entries each.
* Symmetric Difference of two OSets of 100.000 entries each.
* Iteration over an OSet of 100.000 entries.

Other than that, comparison benchmarks were performed against stdlib `Array` and `Set` (as reference) and three other Ordered Set implementations found, [`Bradhilton`](https://github.com/bradhilton/OrderedSet), [`Weebly`](https://github.com/Weebly/OrderedSet) and [`Turbolent`](https://github.com/turbolent/OrderedSet).

Due to some operations being very slow, to prevent comparison benchmarking from taking hours (literally) and producing almost unreadable results, some operations were stepped down in number of entries to 2.000. Said operations are: *Union*, *Intersection*, *Symmetric Difference* and *Subtracting*.

# Run it yourself

Run benchmarks alone with `./mk`.

Creating charts requires `nodejs >= 16`.
Do it with `npm install`, then `./chart.js`.
